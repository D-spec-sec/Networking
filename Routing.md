### OSPF
(Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol used for determining the best path for data packets in a network. It is not an operational mode like Cut through or Store and Forward, so it does not directly relate to minimizing latency or error checking on packets.

### Cut Through
In the Cut through routing operational mode, latency is minimized as the router forwards packets as soon as it has received the destination address. However, error checking on packets is not allowed in this mode, which can lead to potential issues with data integrity.

### Store and Forward
Store and Forwardrouting operational mode involves the router receiving the entire packet before forwarding it to the next hop. This allows for error checking on packets before forwarding, unlike Cut through mode. While it may introduce more latency compared to Cut through, it ensures data integrity.
