Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA): This signaling method utilizes time slices of a specific frequency, allowing each user to access the frequency for a brief, finite period.

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA): This spread-spectrum signaling method permits multiple users to utilize a frequency range by assigning unique codes to each user's data transmission and device.

Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA): In this method, the available frequency range is divided into sub-bands or channels, with each channel assigned to a specific subscriber (device) for the duration of the subscriber's call. The subscriber has exclusive use of this channel throughout the session.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA): Similar to FDMA, OFDMA involves subdividing channels into closely spaced orthogonal frequencies with narrow bandwidths. Each of these subchannels can be transmitted and received simultaneously.
