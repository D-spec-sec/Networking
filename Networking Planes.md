### Data Plane:

Functionality: The data plane, also known as the forwarding plane or user plane, is responsible for the actual transmission and forwarding of user data within the network. It handles the processing and routing of data packets from source to destination based on established network policies and forwarding tables.

Role: Its primary role is to ensure efficient and timely delivery of data while adhering to network protocols and policies.

### Control Plane:

Functionality: The control plane is responsible for managing and controlling the operations of the network. It handles tasks such as routing updates, network topology discovery, and the exchange of control messages between network devices. The control plane determines how data traffic should be forwarded and configures the forwarding tables in the data plane accordingly.

Role: Its role is to maintain the overall health and efficiency of the network by making decisions on how data should be forwarded based on the network's routing algorithms and policies.

### Management Plane:

Functionality: The management plane is responsible for the configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of network devices. It involves tasks such as device configuration, software updates, performance monitoring, and security policy enforcement. Network administrators use the management plane to interact with and manage the network infrastructure.

Role: Its role is to provide a means for administrators to configure and monitor network devices, ensuring that the network operates securely and efficiently.
