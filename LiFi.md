LiFi technology employs visible light communication (VLC) to transmit data wirelessly. Unlike traditional radio frequency (RF) technologies used in Wi-Fi, LiFi utilizes the visible light spectrum, typically via LED light sources, to transmit data. This characteristic allows LiFi to offer high-speed data transmission and can be advantageous in environments where RF communication may be limited or congested. However, it also means that LiFi signals cannot penetrate through walls or other opaque obstacles, and they require a direct line of sight between the transmitter (LED light source) and the receiver (LiFi-enabled device).
